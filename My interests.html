                <h3>Kung fu panda</h3>
                <p>
                  Kung Fu Panda is a 2008 American computer-animated wuxia
                  action comedy film produced by DreamWorks Animation and
                  distributed by Paramount Pictures.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In the Valley of Peace, a land in Ancient China inhabited by
                  anthropomorphic animals, Po the giant panda is a fan of kung
                  fu who idolizes the Furious Five – Tigress, Monkey, Crane,
                  Viper, and Mantis – a quintet of kung fu masters trained by
                  Master Shifu the red panda. However, Po is unable to pursue
                  his dream of learning kung fu while he helps his father, Mr. 
                  Ping the goose, in his noodle restaurant.
                  <p>
                    Grand Master Oogway, an old Galápagos tortoise and Shifu's mentor, 
                    has a vision that Shifu's former protégé, the evil snow leopard Tai 
                    Lung, will escape from prison and return to the valley to exact his 
                    revenge for being denied the Dragon Scroll. Panicked, Shifu sends his messenger, 
                    with a request for the prison to tighten its security. 
                    He then holds a tournament for the Furious Five so that Oogway can identify 
                    the Dragon Warrior, the one kung fu master worthy of receiving the Dragon 
                    Scroll. Po arrives too late to enter the arena; desperate to see the Dragon 
                    Warrior, Po straps himself to a set of fireworks and launches himself into 
                    the middle of the arena in front of Oogway as he points towards the Dragon 
                    Warrior. To the astonishment of everyone present, Oogway proclaims 
                    Po as the chosen warrior.

                  Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse is a 2018 
                  American computer-animated superhero film featuring

                  <p>
                    New York City teenager Miles Morales struggles to live up 
                    to the expectations of his father, police officer Jefferson 
                    Davis, who sees Spider-Man as a menace. Miles adjusts to 
                    boarding school, and visits his uncle Aaron Davis, who 
                    takes him to an abandoned subway station to paint graffiti. 
                    Miles is bitten by a radioactive spider and gains spider-like 
                    abilities similar to Spider-Man.

                <h3>WALL-E</h3>
                <p>
                  WALL-E (stylized with an interpunct as WALL·E) 
                  is a 2008 American computer-animated science 
                  fiction romance film produced by Pixar Animation

                <p>
                  In the 29th century, rampant consumerism and environmental 
                  neglect have turned Earth into a garbage-strewn wasteland; 
                  humanity has been evacuated by the megacorporation Buy-N-Large 
                  (BnL) on giant starliners seven centuries earlier. Of all the 
                  robotic trash compactors left by BnL to clean up, only one 
                  remains operational: a Waste Allocation Load-Lifter: Earth 
                  Class named WALL-E. One day, WALL-E's routine of compressing 
                  trash and collecting interesting objects is broken by the 
                  arrival of an unmanned probe carrying an Extraterrestrial 
                  Vegetation Evaluator named EVE, sent to scan the planet 
                  for human-sustainable life. WALL-E is smitten by the sleek, 
                  otherworldly robot; and the two begin to connect until EVE 
                  goes into standby when WALL-E shows her his most recent find: 
                  a living seedling. The probe then collects EVE and the plant, 
                  and—with WALL-E clinging on—returns to its mothership, the 
                  starliner Axiom.
