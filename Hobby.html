      <h2>What are my hoppies?</h2>
              <p> Well, I have 2 main hobbies. Which is:
              <p>Gaming and drawing
                </p>
              </p>
            </td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>
              <p>
                Depending on my mood it depends on which one of my hobbies I do. 
                Like if I'm happy than I usual be drawing my avatar. 
                And if I'm bored than I play a game, either on my PC, nintendo switch or my 3Ds. 
                The games I normally play are 1 player games and role-playing. I really like to play 
                games alone, beacuse if a game is multiplayer than you could expect people to point out then you 
                do something bad/embarrassing. And I really hate that, even if just a joke. So I just play games 
                that are made for one player. 
                <p>
                  The games I listed down here are my favorites at the moment. I won't write down why I 
                  love the games but I think you will see a pattern between them and figure it out. 
                </p>

  <h3>Fire Emblem: Three Houses</h3>
  <img src="Three houses.png" alt="Picture of the cover for the game" width="300" height="300">
  <p>Fire Emblem is 1 player, Adventure, Tactical Role-Playing game 
    and was published worldwide by Nintendo on July 26, 2019 
    <p>
      The game takes place on the continent of Fódlan. The landmass is 
      divided into three rival nations who are now at peace: the Adrestian 
      Empire to the southwest, the Holy Kingdom of Faerghus to the north, 
      and the Leicester Alliance to the east. At the center of the continent 
      is the Garreg Mach Monastery, a neutral territory home to both the Church 
      of Seiros and the Officers Academy. The game's "Three Houses" refer to the 
      three boarding houses of the academy, the Black Eagles, the Blue Lions, 
      and the Golden Deer, each populated with students from the three main nations. 
      Additionally underneath Garreg Mach Monastery is a place for rejects of society 
      called Abyss, and a house in name alone, the Ashen Wolves.
      <p>
        In ancient times, a war raged between the Church's titular founder Seiros and 
        the "Liberation King" Nemesis, an era which also saw the establishment of the Empire. 
        In the thousand years since then, the Kingdom split away from the Empire, then the Alliance
        declared its independence from both powers. A prolonged conflict ensued, with the Church being 
        responsible for maintaining peace. Key to the nations of Fódlan are Crests, magical sigils passed 
        down through families that play key roles in the continent's history and politics.
        <p>
          The game is set during two time periods. The first begins in Imperial Year 1180, during the 
          characters' time as students at the Officers Academy. The story then jumps five years later 
          to the time of a promised reunion between students, only for the three nations to now be 
          seemingly at war with each other.

  <h3>Sid Meier's Civilization V</h3>
  <img src="Civilization.jpeg" alt="Picture of the cover for the game" width="300" height="300">
  <p> Sid Meier's Civilization V (called Civilization V or Civ5 for short) is a 1 player, 
    turn-based strategy game and was released on September 21, 2010.</p>
    <p>
      There are eighteen civilizations available from the start of Civilization V, 
      and seven additional civilizations are made available later through several 
      small DLC add-ons. Nine more civilizations were added with the Gods & Kings 
      expansion pack, and nine other civilizations were added with the Brave New World 
      expansion pack, bringing the total number of civilizations to 43, the greatest 
      number of civilizations that has ever been available in any Civilization game.
      <p>
        This is the first incarnation of the series where the leaders speak in their native 
        language in a fully animated diplomacy screen. This only applies to the audio; all 
        text is in the language selected.

  <h3>Star Wars: Knights Of The Old Republic</h3>
  <img src="knights.jpg" alt="Picture of the cover for the game" width="300" height="300">
  <p>Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic (KotOR) is a 1 player, 
    roleplaying game and was released to PC November 19, 2003</p>
    <p>
      KotOR is the first computer RPG set in the Star Wars universe. 
      It uses the d20 System, from the Wizards of the Coast Star Wars 
      Roleplaying Game rules. The game also allows the player to either 
      be a servant to the light side of the Force or the dark side, using 
      an alignment system that tracks actions, from simple dialogue choices 
      to major plot decisions. Combat is turn-based. Time is divided into discrete 
      rounds, and combatants attack/react simultaneously. However, the number 
      of actions a combatant may perform each round is limited. While the round's 
      duration is a fixed short interval of real time (around six seconds), the 
      player can configure the combat system to pause at specific events or at the 
      end of each round.
      <p>
        This is based on the canonical male light side version of the game and assumes 
        that the planets are visited in the order Dantooine, Tatooine, Kashyyyk, 
        Manaan, then Korriban. Gender, order of planets visited and other variables 
        can differ depending on the input of the player.

  <h3>Long Live The Queen</h3>
  <img src="queen.jpg" alt="Picture of the cover for the game" width="300" height="300">
  <p>Long Live the Queen is a 1 player, visual novel role-playing video 
    game. It was released on June 2, 2012. The game uses anime-style graphics and is 
    written in English.</p>
  <p>
    The queen of Nova has recently died, and her daughter, the 14-year-old 
    princess Elodie, must leave her schooling to ready herself to become the 
    next queen. Her coronation is set for 40 weeks from the present—her 15th 
    birthday. Many people in the kingdom are trying to take advantage of the 
    recent monarch's death and attempt to kill Elodie.
  </p>
  <p>
    The player reads through the story and schedules the protagonist's weekly 
    lessons, in topics such as economy, foreign affairs, logistics, expression, 
    military matters, self-defense, intrigues, doublespeak and magic. 
    Based on those activities, Elodie increases her proficiency in various statistics. 
    Additionally, during the weekend Elodie has free run of the castle and can choose 
    an activity that alters her mood. She has four emotional axes, and her position on
    each determines her proficiency at learning certain topics: for instance, being "Willful" 
    will help her master military and intrigue skills easier, but it will also hamper learning 
    civil skills like royal demeanor. Once all three sub skills of a particular skill are raised 
    to a certain point (around 30 each), Elodie gains an outfit that boosts that specific skill. 
    Learning some skills unlocks additional weekend actions: for example, learning "Dance" allows 
    her to attend balls, while "Reflexes" gives her the ability to play tennis.

  <h3>Pokemon: Omaga Ruby</h3>
  <img src="pokemon.jpg" alt="Picture of the cover for the game" width="300" height="300">
  <p>Pokemon: Omega Ruby is 2014 enhanced remakes of the 2002 role-playing video games Pokémon 
    Ruby. The game is part of the sixth generation of the Pokémon video game series</p>
    <p>
      The setting and story of Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire are largely the same as the original 
      Ruby game. The game begin as the player is seen riding in the back of a moving truck. The player 
      character starts by moving to the Hoenn region from the Johto region with their mother, 
      as their father Norman has been hired as the leader of the Petalburg City Gym. The player 
      arrives with their parents at the family's new home in the village of Littleroot Town, on 
      the southern edge of the main island. The player character begins their Pokémon Trainer 
      journey by saving Professor Birch, the leading scientist in the Hoenn region, from a wild 
      Pokémon, choosing either Treecko, Torchic or Mudkip to defend him. Following the defeat 
      of the wild Pokémon, the player receives the chosen Pokémon as their starter. They then 
      travel around Hoenn to complete their Pokédex and battle the eight Gym Leaders of the 
      Hoenn Pokémon League.
      <p>
        Along the way, the player character encounters the antagonist group Team Magma in Omega Ruby 
        who wish to use the power of the legendary Pokémon, Primal Groudon in Omega Ruby, to change 
        the world to suit their desires. Team Magma wants to use Groudon to dry up the oceans and 
        expand the landmass, thereby allowing humanity to progress further. With the help of Hoenn 
        League Champion Steven Stone and the Gym Leader Wallace, the player defeats their respective 
        team and then either captures or defeats the legendary Pokémon to prevent a global drought / 
        heavy rainfall and thus ensuring the teams' mutual reformation. The player then advances on to 
        the Pokémon League, challenging the Elite Four and then the Champion, Steven, to become the new 
        Hoenn Pokémon League Champion. The player also has the option of participating in the various 
        Pokémon Contests throughout Hoenn, using their Pokémon to put on a performance for an audience 
        and judges.
