            <p>
              About my childhood?… For starters, I was born and raised in the
              countryside or at least near the countryside. What I mean is
              that I live near different sizes of forests, the nearest
              shopping center was 20 minutes car ride away, almost took an
              hour to get to the city with car and I live 10 minutes from
              farms by walking speed. So yeah, I live in the countryside
              according to some people.
            </p>
            <p>
              <p>
                But I like living here. For example, I love that there are
                forests almost around every corner because I love to claim trees
                and when I was little I always imagined that I was in a fantasy
                world surrounded by a magic forest. I also like that it’s quiet
                here. You don’t hear a lot of cars around here instead you hear
                the sound from the forest live and children playing. So it gets
                a calm and friendly atmosphere to where I live.

              <h1>My school life - From Preschool year to year 6</h1>
              <p>
                When I was a kid, I was very happy and played outside almost
                every day but I was also a quiet and shy kid. It was almost
                impossible to ruin my good mood. … But my happy mood quickly
                changed when I was in school. That was because I got bullied
                by my other classmates. I was bullied for having a big
                fantasy when playing pretend which lead to me being called
                “The weird kid”. Plus, I was very bad at controlling my
                emotions at that age, so I cried a lot when I was feeling a
                bit sad and when I was angry I would either cry or shout at
                people to leave me alone. So I was being called a “crybaby”
                a lot. In the consultation, I was bullied for being “weird”
                and being a crybaby. And in that school, I was bullied for 8
                years by the same people every day, it started when I was in
                preschool year (I was 6 years old) and it ended in year 6 (I
                was 13 years old). Throughout this time, I really hated
                school and I didn’t care at all about my grades and I also
                skipped a lot, I tried to skip every day by telling my
                parents that I was sick.

            <h2>School life - year 7 to second year of high school</h2>
            <p>
              The bullying stopped when I changed schools since my old school only 
              had up to year 6. So when I started year 7 it was in a new school with 
              new people and it was a whole lot better there than in my previous 
              school. In my new school, I went there from year 7 to year 9 and I 
              really liked that school. The students there were really nice, well 
              most of them were and I had real friends that generally cared for me
              and I wasn’t bullied anymore. And at this time I started to care about 
              my grades and I hardly skipped any schooldays. And because of this, I 
              got into the high school that I wanted to go to. Sadly, I don’t have any 
              contact with my friends from that school but I still meet them on the way 
              home from high school.
              <p>
                Now I’m in my second year of high school, age 17. My first year of high 
                school was probably the best school year I’ve ever had. High school totally 
                beat year 1 - year 9, because in my first year I had more fun and learned 
                more things than the other school years combined. The reason why I say this 
                is because I go to a school that I really wanted to go to, so I was happy to 
                know that I was accepted. I also loved my first year is because the school is 
                in the capital, Stockholm. And a bonus is that to my knowledge, I’m the only one 
                from my previous schools that goes to this one. So I felt like I got a new start 
                at school and I absolutely loved it. And the students here were so nice and I felt 
                I could be myself all the time because so many people had the same interests as me 
                and it was very refreshing to connect to so many people. It also helps that I choose 
                a program that seemed really intriguing to me and it lived up to my expectations. 
                The program I choose was cumputer science. So yeah, my first year was amazing, 
                and what I have seen so far in my second year I know that I choose the right program 
                and the right school.
